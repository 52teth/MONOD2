# MONOD2
MONOD2 is a set of programs for methylation haplotype analysis for bisulfite sequencing or (BS-seq) data using high-throughput sequencing.  The analysis can be divided into three parts. First sequence alignment files are analyzed by Perl programs to generate methylation haplotypes which includes haplotype strings and haplotype counts for CpG positions with coverage.  Next, a collection of methylation haplotype files can be analyzed for identification of methylation haplotype blocks or for differential methylation haplotype load. 

MONOD2 is comprised of sets of 'sh', 'perl', and 'R' scripts.
